		<p>Hi, I'm Julia!  I grew up on a CUCUMBER FARM in a small town in NC.  I went to college for International Business and Spanish at UNC-Wilmington, and ended up staying in Wilmington, working as a paralegal for a real estate attorney.  Eventually, I decided that it was time to leave the beach bum life, and I moved to Raleigh, to work for SoftPro - this is the that company created the software that I had been using as a paralegal for several years.  I've been at Softpro for 4.5 years now.  I've worked my way up from Support Rep to Configuration Specialist.  This brings me to now -- it's time to take my skills to new heights and learn coding!</p>
