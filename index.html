		<p>Hi, I'm Julia! I grew up on a cucumber farm in a small town in NC.  I moved to Wilmington, NC for college, and ended up sticking around for 12 years.  I finally gave up the beach bum life, and moved to Raleigh in 2013 to work for a software company.  That brings us to now.  I can't wait to begin my new journey with coding!</p>
		<p> In my free time, you can find me in the gym! I love weight lifting, and have competed in a few body-building shows.  I also enjoy cooking, traveling, reading, eating vanilla almond butter out of the jar, and talking about wanting a puppy.</p>
